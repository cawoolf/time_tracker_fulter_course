***General Notes from the Course***

A Widget is an object that describes part of the user interface
    > Everything visible on the screen is a Widget

Command + click goes to the superclass/documentation for the Flutter class

UI's are always defined decoratively

All UI's can be described with a WidgetTree diagram (See 5.73)

Stateless Widgets are given constant configuration, they are all initialized
with immutable attributes on build. UI will always be rendered in the same way.

Stateful Widget can be given configuration on build, but can define mutable states
    > Data might vary and change the display of the UI
    > Overrides the createState() method
        > Another State class instance is assigned createState()

When data is changed use setState() to rebuild the UI for Stateful Widgets
