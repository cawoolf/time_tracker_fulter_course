***General Notes from the Course***

A Widget is an object that describes part of the user interface
    > Everything visible on the screen is a Widget

Command + click goes to the superclass/documentation for the Flutter class

UI's are always defined decoratively

All UI's can be described with a WidgetTree diagram (See 5.73)

Stateless Widgets are given constant configuration, they are all initialized
with immutable attributes on build. UI will always be rendered in the same way.

Stateful Widget can be given configuration on build, but can define mutable states
    > Data might vary and change the display of the UI
    > Overrides the createState() method
        > Another State class instance is assigned createState()

When data is changed use setState() to rebuild the UI for Stateful Widgets

Best practice to make packages and folders for specific pages of the app
that contains all widgets and such relevant to that page.

Where you put the , in the dart code determines how its auto formatted

Used SizedBox widget to create space between Widgets inside a Container

Disable Buttons by setting onPressed to null

Extract common_widgets into their own directory for re-usability
    > Use Constructors for customization

Use wrap with widget command for SizedBoxed

Callbacks are used to pass states from children to parent Widgets
